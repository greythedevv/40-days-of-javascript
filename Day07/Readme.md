✅ Day 07 – 40 Days of JavaScript Completed
📌 Overview

Day 07 focused on applying JavaScript fundamentals to build interactive, logic driven mini games. The goal was to strengthen understanding of control flow, user input handling, recursion, loops, and random number generation by implementing real world problem solving scenarios.

Two browser based games were developed to simulate user interaction and decision making.

🎮 Projects Built
🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game

An interactive game where the user competes against the computer by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

🔹 Features

Accepts user input using browser prompts

Random computer selection using Math.random()

Determines game results based on logical comparisons

Handles win, lose, and tie scenarios

Allows replay using recursion

Converts user input to lowercase for consistency

🔹 Concepts Practiced

Functions and function calls

Switch statements

Conditional logic

Random number generation

Recursion

Input normalization

🔢 Number Guessing Game

A guessing game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.

🔹 Features

Secret number generation using Math.random()

Continuous user guessing using a while loop

Input validation using isNaN

Feedback system indicating whether guesses are too high or too low

Attempt counter to track user performance

Replay option after successful guessing

🔹 Concepts Practiced

Loop control using while

Guard clause pattern with continue

Parsing numeric input using parseInt

Logical comparison operators

State tracking using variables

User driven program flow

🧠 Key Lessons Learned

Understanding when to use loops versus recursion

Managing program flow based on user input

Writing condition based repetition logic

Implementing randomness in games

Structuring functions for reusable logic

Improving debugging and error handling skills

Strengthening algorithmic thinking

🛠️ Technologies Used
