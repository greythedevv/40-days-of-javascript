📘 Day 06 of 40 Days of JavaScript

This repository documents my progress on Day 06 of the 40 Days of JavaScript challenge.
The focus for this day was strengthening my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, especially functions, control flow, string manipulation, and execution context.

All exercises were implemented using vanilla JavaScript and tested via the browser console.

🛠 Skills Practiced

JavaScript functions and parameters

Loops and conditional logic

String manipulation methods

Mathematical operations

Callbacks and higher order functions

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Understanding the JavaScript call stack

Writing clean, readable logic

📌 Exercises Completed
1. Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit)

Implemented a function that converts Celsius values to Fahrenheit using the standard formula.

Concepts used

Arithmetic operators

Function parameters

Console output

2. Maximum of Two Numbers

Created a function that compares two numbers and outputs the greater value, including support for negative numbers.

Concepts used

Conditional statements

Comparison operators

3. Palindrome Checker

Built a function to determine whether a string is a palindrome by reversing the string and comparing results.

Concepts used

String methods

Logical comparison

Case normalization

4. Factorial Calculation

Developed a factorial function using a loop to multiply values from n down to 1.

Concepts used

Loops

Accumulator variables

Mathematical logic

5. Vowel Counter

Created a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

Concepts used

Iterating over strings

includes() method

Returning values from functions

6. Capitalizing Words in a Sentence

Implemented logic to capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence.

Concepts used

String splitting and joining

Array iteration

String reconstruction

7. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Used IIFEs to execute functions immediately, including passing arguments through parameters.

Concepts used

Function expressions

Scope control

Immediate execution

8. Callback Functions

Demonstrated how functions can be passed as arguments and executed within other functions.

Concepts used

First class functions

Callbacks

Function execution flow

9. JavaScript Call Stack Analysis

Practiced tracing how functions enter and exit the call stack during execution.

Concepts used

Execution context

Stack order (LIFO)

Nested function calls

🎯 Key Learnings

Clear distinction between return and console.log

Strings are immutable and must be rebuilt to be modified

Functions can be stored, passed, and executed dynamically

JavaScript executes code sequentially using the call stack

Writing readable logic is more important than writing short code

🚀 Progress Update
